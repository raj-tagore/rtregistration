- a simple website that protects against unauthorised zoom-meeting logins.
- zoom meeting access is only given when a participant enters his details correctly
- each participant has a login counter that updates everytime he logs in, so this prevents sharing of passwords
- the zoom link is embedded in a button, so participants dont have access to the link
- there **are** loopholes, but this is a simple solution for less tech-savvy participants, and it works
